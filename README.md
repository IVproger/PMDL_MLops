# PMDL Assignment №1: MLOps Solution for X-Ray Chest Kaggle Competition 

This repository contains the MLOps pipeline developed by **Ivan Golov**, a student of Innopolis University (AI-01 Group). The goal of this project is to build and deploy a machine learning model to classify chest X-ray images as part of a Kaggle competition.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find a basic machine learning model that processes X-ray chest images and performs classification. The model is built and trained using Jupyter notebooks, which are available in the `notebooks/` directory.

After model training and validation, the solution is deployed using **Gradio** as the front-end interface and **Docker** for containerization, making it easy to deploy in any environment.

## Key Components

1. **Model Development**: 
   - The basic machine learning model is implemented using standard libraries and frameworks. Please refer to the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder for details on model architecture, training procedures, and evaluation metrics.

2. **Gradio Interface**: 
   - A user-friendly interface is built using Gradio to allow users to upload X-ray images and receive predictions directly from the model.

3. **Docker Deployment**: 
   - The project is containerized using Docker for seamless deployment. Instructions for building and running the Docker container can be found in the `Dockerfile` and below.

## Setup Instructions

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IVproger/PMDL_MLops.git
    cd PMDL_MLops
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed. If you want run notebooks and modify the project, you can install dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -Ur requirements.txt
    ```

### Docker Setup

1. **Build Docker Image**:
    ```
    docker-compose build
    ```

2. **Run Docker Container**:
    ```
    docker-compose up
    ```

   This will start the Gradio app on `http://localhost:7860`.
